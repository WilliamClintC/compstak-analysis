  In this project, we conducted an initial review of the CompStak dataset to assess its suitability for analyzing commercial properties in the United States. Each field was individually evaluated, with a focus on 'Property Type' and 'Property Subtype'. Our analysis revealed that while fill rates for 'Property Type' are high (95–99%), 'Property Subtype' fields exhibit higher missingness (up to 28%), potentially complicating downstream analysis.We verified that property IDs are generally stable across time and regions, although inconsistencies in property type and subtype classifications were noted in a small fraction of records (<0.02%). To benchmark the dataset’s coverage, we compared the number of properties captured in CompStak against external (unverified) estimates of U.S. commercial properties. Our findings indicate non-uniform coverage across property types and states. Specifically, industrial, office, and retail sectors are relatively well-represented, whereas sectors like land and multifamily properties show significant undercoverage. Geographically, West Coast states such as California show higher representation, and regression analysis suggests that coverage rates increase with the number of commercial properties in a given state, indicating increasing returns to scale in data collection. Challenges remain, particularly in mapping category definitions across different datasets, such as the DOE and CoStar sources. Future work will focus on improving benchmark estimates using the DOE dataset and establishing a reliable mapping of property categories between datasets to ensure meaningful comparisons.

## Initial Analysis {#sec-intro}

Each field was reviewed individually to identify potential patterns, and all fields appeared relevant for analysis.
The broader data set includes several types of industry classifications, such as 'Property Type', 'Property Sub type', 'Space Type', 'Tenant SIC Code/Description', and 'Tenant NAICS Code/Description'.
However, there is no clear documentation explaining the differences between these classifications or indicating which should be preferred.
In our case, only 'Property Type' and 'Property Sub type' are available, so our analysis will focus on these variables.
It is important to note that these classifications are not consistently available across both lease and sales records, which may introduce challenges to our analysis.
Additionally, NAICS and SIC codes are not included in our data set because they are a premium add-on.
Finally, 'Space Type' is only available for lease data, which may also pose limitations.

We observe "fill rate" (@tbl-one), wherein a low fill rate would correspond to a large portion of the entries having Nan or missing values.
Unique values shows us that the categories used for property type and property sub type are consistent.

| Data set | Type             | Fill Rate | Unique Values |
|----------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Sales    | Property type    | 95%       | 8             |
| Lease    | Property type    | 99%       | 8             |
| Sales    | Property Subtype | 75%       | 56            |
| Lease    | Property Subtype | 66%       | 56            |

: Data set Initial Analysis {#tbl-one}

We also investigate whether property IDs are consistent.
We expect that a given commercial property would exhibit stable characteristics, with its location and industry classification remaining unchanged over time.
Our analysis confirms this expectation: property IDs are stable and pass state consistency checks.
However, it is important to note that property types and sub types are not consistent.
See @fig-propertyid and @tbl-property_subtype

![Property ID Unstable Classifications](images/Screenshot%202025-04-26%20133959-01.png){#fig-propertyid}

Despite concerns about inconsistency, this is not a major issue, as the number of unstable observations is relatively small compared to the total number of properties.
Specifically, property type inconsistency is observed in only 39 cases, and property sub type inconsistency in 96 cases.
This pales in comparison to the 759,623 unique properties in our data set.

What is more concerning is the Nan surrounding each property type and sub type.
Wherein the Nan values for property sub types can be as high as 28% of the data.
See @tbl-two

| Error Type            | Industry Category Type | Number           | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Inconsistent Category | Property Type          | 39 / 759623      | 0.00513%   |
| Inconsistent Category | Property Subtype       | 96 / 759623      | 0.01264%   |
| Nan                   | Property Type          | 37020 / 759623   |  4.87%     |
| Nan                   | Property Subtype       |  213255 / 759623 |  28.07%    |

## Strategy

We will begin by matching the number of buildings.
Specifically, we observe unique property IDs in the data set, allowing us to estimate the number of commercial properties in the United States.
The total number of commercial properties is a relatively stable metric to study compared to more volatile measures such as valuations or square footage.

Using this approach, we can first compare aggregate numbers, starting with the total number of properties in the United States, and then work our way downward to industry-level and state-level comparisons.

We first assess how much of the national commercial property market is captured in our data set.
We assume that the CompStak data set represents only a small subsection of the total U.S. market.
However, a key concern is whether these observations are uniformly distributed across regions and industries, or if there are systematic biases.
For example, are retail properties in California more likely to be reported than warehouses in Michigan?

To begin, we pull external estimates of the total number of commercial properties from publicly available internet sources.
Although these external figures are unverified, they provide a useful starting point for benchmarking and analyzing the coverage of our data set.
See @tbl-Industry and @tbl-State

## Results

The following analysis uses unverified U.S. figures.
We observe evidence of non-uniform coverage.
If we assume the complete circle represents the true total number of U.S. commercial properties, then the CompStak data represents a subsample of this total.
The "Covered" section reflects properties captured in the CompStak dataset, while the "Gap" represents the "missing" properties not covered.

As shown in @fig-sunburst1 , office, industrial, and retail sectors appear relatively well covered.
Industrial coverage is approximately 53%, while office and retail each have around 22% coverage.
Coverage for the remaining sectors is negligible, with less than 5% represented.

![](images/filtered_coverage_sunburst_20250424_234213.png){#fig-sunburst1}

In particular see @fig-sunburst2 see that land and multi-family have extremely low coverage, at the same time representing a large portion of total US commercial properties.

![](images/complete_coverage_sunburst_20250425_110035.jpg){#fig-sunburst2}

Using the same data set, I investigated the uniformity of coverage across states.
The analysis reveals that the CompStak dataset exhibits a bias toward West Coast states.
As shown in @fig-map, the coverage rate is calculated by assuming the externally sourced U.S. data set estimate provides the true number of commercial properties, with the CompStak dataset representing a subset.
For example, California has an 18% coverage rate, meaning that the number of commercial property observations in CompStak accounts for 18% of the estimated 917,860 commercial properties in California.

![](images/coverage_percentage_redblue_20250425_010815.jpg){#fig-map}

Next, we examine the determinants of this observation.
Specifically, I assess whether the coverage rate is a function of the total number of commercial properties in each state, again assuming that our U.S. estimate represents the true total.
As shown in @fig-prop1, there is evidence to support this theory.
States with a greater number of commercial properties tend to have higher coverage rates in the CompStak dataset, as indicated by the linear regression results in @fig-prop1.
This pattern suggests that there are fixed costs associated with data collection in each location, and that data providers are more likely to specialize in areas with larger commercial markets.
As a result, the dataset exhibits increasing returns to scale, which introduces bias into our observations.

![](images/7.png){#fig-prop1}

A similar analysis was conducted using property types, but several challenges were encountered.
Specifically, the top two outliers significantly skewed the regression line, suggesting potential issues with category interpretation or data quality.
Further investigation is warranted to better understand these anomalies.
However, it is noteworthy that when these outliers are excluded, the regression line again shows a positive relationship: property types with more commercial properties tend to have higher CompStak coverage rates.
The corresponding graph can be found in the appendix.

## Concluding Thoughts

NAICS and SIC codes may be worth considering, given their standardized format and consistency across multiple datasets, depending on our analytical needs.
We also realized that our observations may be biased due to unverified numbers in our current data set.
Therefore, to ensure greater accuracy, we will be studying the DOE dataset of estimated numbers of commercial properties in the United States ([CoStar Glossary](https://www.costar.com/about/costar-glossary), [DOE Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-and-county-commercial-building-inventories-010d2)).

While this is a good starting point, it will require significant effort to reliably reproduce our unverified US estimate data using the DOE dataset.
Determining the appropriate mapping and definitions takes time.
For example, the DOE categorizes commercial properties under terms such as "sports and entertainment" or "specialty," which may not directly correspond to the categories used in the CompStak dataset.
The [CoStar Glossary](https://www.costar.com/about/costar-glossary) provides definitions for some of these categories, and a comparison with @tbl-Industry in our dataset highlights these differences.
This underscores the need for careful mapping and interpretation when aligning categories across datasets.

A careful review of category definitions and thoughtful value judgments will be necessary to establish equivalencies and ensure meaningful comparisons in our analysis.
Additionally, it would be beneficial to determine whether a comprehensive glossary of categories exists for the CompStak dataset.
To the best of my knowledge, there is currently no CompStak glossary that is directly comparable to the [CoStar Glossary](https://www.costar.com/about/costar-glossary).
