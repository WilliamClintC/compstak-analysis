  This is a continuation of Part 1. Reading part 1 is unecessary and this document is structured to read part 2 as a stand alone version.This paper analyzes the CompStak commercial property dataset, focusing on classification consistency and geographic coverage. While 'Property Type' and 'Property Subtype' are generally populated, subtype fields are missing in 28% of records and show some inconsistence. Property IDs are stable, allowing reliable property counts. By mapping CompStak to DOE building categories, we estimate 35% national coverage. However, representation is uneven, with strong western and large-market bias. These findings highlight classification challenges and non-uniform geographic coverage.

## Initial Analysis {#sec-intro}

Each field was reviewed individually to identify potential patterns, and all fields appeared relevant for analysis.
The broader data set includes several types of industry classifications, such as 'Property Type', 'Property Sub type', 'Space Type', 'Tenant SIC Code/Description', and 'Tenant NAICS Code/Description'.
However, there is no clear documentation explaining the differences between these classifications or indicating which should be preferred.
In our case, only 'Property Type' and 'Property Sub type' are available, so our analysis will focus on these variables.
It is important to note that these classifications are not consistently available across both lease and sales records, which may introduce challenges to our analysis.
Additionally, NAICS and SIC codes are not included in our data set because they are a premium add-on.
Finally, 'Space Type' is only available for lease data, which may also pose limitations.

We observe "fill rate" (@tbl-one), wherein a low fill rate would correspond to a large portion of the entries having Nan or missing values.
Unique values shows us that the categories used for property type and property sub type are consistent.

| Data set | Type             | Fill Rate | Unique Values |
|----------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Sales    | Property type    | 95%       | 8             |
| Lease    | Property type    | 99%       | 8             |
| Sales    | Property Subtype | 75%       | 56            |
| Lease    | Property Subtype | 66%       | 56            |

: Data set Initial Analysis {#tbl-one}

We also investigate whether property IDs are consistent.
We expect that a given commercial property would exhibit stable characteristics, with its location and industry classification remaining unchanged over time.
Our analysis confirms this expectation: property IDs are stable and pass state consistency checks.
However, it is important to note that property types and sub types are not consistent.
See @fig-propertyid and @tbl-property_subtype

![Property ID Unstable Classifications](images/Screenshot%202025-04-26%20133959-01.png){#fig-propertyid}

Despite concerns about inconsistency, this is not a major issue, as the number of unstable observations is relatively small compared to the total number of properties.
Specifically, property type inconsistency is observed in only 39 cases, and property sub type inconsistency in 96 cases.
This pales in comparison to the 759,623 unique properties in our data set.

What is more concerning is the Nan surrounding each property type and sub type.
Wherein the Nan values for property sub types can be as high as 28% of the data.
See @tbl-two

| Error Type            | Industry Category Type | Number          | Percentage |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Inconsistent Category | Property Type          | 39 / 759623     | 0.00513%   |
| Inconsistent Category | Property Subtype       | 96 / 759623     | 0.01264%   |
| Nan                   | Property Type          | 37020 / 759623  | 4.87%      |
| Nan                   | Property Subtype       | 213255 / 759623 | 28.07%     |

## Strategy

We will begin by matching the number of buildings.
Specifically, we observe unique property IDs in the data set, allowing us to estimate the number of commercial properties in the United States.
The total number of commercial properties is a relatively stable metric to study compared to more volatile measures such as valuations or square footage.

Using this approach, we can first compare aggregate numbers, starting with the total number of properties in the United States, and then work our way downward to industry-level and state-level comparisons.

We first assess how much of the national commercial property market is captured in our data set.
We assume that the CompStak data set represents only a small subsection of the total U.S. market.
However, a key concern is whether these observations are uniformly distributed across regions and industries, or if there are systematic biases.
For example, are retail properties in California more likely to be reported than warehouses in Michigan?

To begin, we pull external estimates of the total number of commercial properties from [DOE Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-and-county-commercial-building-inventories-010d2).
Although these external figures are not entirely accurate, they provide a useful starting point for benchmarking and analyzing the coverage of our data set.

## Methodology

They key to this analysis is matching the different category structure that exists within the DOE data set and the Compstak data set.

First we discuss the categories in the DOE dataset.
There are direct matches.
For example "industrial" appears as a category in both data sets.
At the same time there are ambiguous data sets such as "speciality", which can take the form of a casino to a recycling center.
In order to work around this we do the matching into two steps.
The first step is the direct mapping, where categories with the same name are matched one for one.
The second step is the ambiguous mapping, where categories are mapped based on their subcategory.
To understand this approach, we note how the data set is structured.
There is a main category type along with a sub type.
The ambiguous mapping maps based on the subcategory, disregarding the main category.
It is also to note that no entries or Nan entries are automatically assigned to "others" category.
This potentially overestimates our "others" category, as we see later on in @fig-count .
The mapping can be found in @tbl-Mapping .

Finally, we discuss the categories in the Compstak dataset.
Ideally, we would want to match the DOE categories exactly to the Compstak categories.
The reason being that DOE has 11 categories and Compstak has 8 categories ( @tbl-Category_Compare) .
Unfortunately, the Compstak categories also contains ambiguous definitions that are unattributable to the DOE categories, namely "Mixed-Use" and "Land".
We create mappings to address this by using their respective subcategories (@tbl-Category_Mapping).

As a result we end up with 6 categories (Hotel, Industrial, Multi-Family, Office, Other, Retail).

## Results

We first look at @fig-count We see that the scales of the categories are mostly consistent in both of the datasets.
Furthermore, we see the overestimation bias we have with "other" category.
Beyond that our results suggest consistency within the Compstak data set.

![](images/clipboard-46274019.png){#fig-count}

Next we look into the percentages of the DOE vs Compstak data set.
We expect that the percentage of each category with respect to the total of each data set should be consistent.
It is to note we remove "other" category due to overestimation.
We see that the pie chart is mostly consistent with the DOE, suggesting valid consistent data.
@fig-pie

![](images/donut_comparison_no_other_20250430_180249.png){#fig-pie}

Assuming DOE dataset, contains the total commercial property in the us.
We create a variable called coverage rate, which is the number of commercial properties of Compstak divided by the DOE data set.
From this we observe a few things, "other" category is once again an outlier.
Aside from this, we see that all other categories have decent coverage rates @fig-coverage @fig-coverage_pie .

![](images/2.png){#fig-coverage}

We also see decently overall coverage rate of almost 35% (assuming DOE is the total).

![](images/3.png){#fig-coverage_pie}

In line with our coverage rate analysis, we now plot by state.
We see a big western bias for west coast states.
Red indicates a high coverage.
@fig-map .
In theory, uniform coverage would imply a consistent number across all states.
This suggest that our data is ununiform and biased to western states.
CA covers as high as 70%, this is in start difference to the 33% aggregate coverage rate we saw prior.

![](images/5.png){#fig-map}

We have now establish a western bias to coverage rates.
But now we also investigate weather the number of properties within the state is also a variable to understand coverage rates As shown in @fig-regress , there is evidence to support this theory.
States with a greater number of commercial properties tend to have higher coverage rates.
This pattern may be explained that there are fixed costs associated with data collection in each location, and that data providers are more likely to specialize in areas with larger commercial markets.
As a result, the data set exhibits increasing returns to scale, which introduces bias into our observations.

![](images/6.png){#fig-regress}

Next, we use both state and categorization to produce a visualization.
@fig-heatmap .
From this we see that "others" category is introducing bias into our data set.
Therefore, we remove "others" category for our next visualization.

![](images/7-01.png){#fig-heatmap}

@fig-heatmap_fix .The unevenness of the data set is clearly illustrated in this visualization.
Notably, the industrial and multifamily categories in Nevada, California, and Arizona show consistently higher coverage rates compared to other regions.
Additionally, New York exhibits particularly high coverage for office properties relative to its industrial sector, which is an interesting deviation.
These patterns further support the theory of increasing returns to scale in data collection.
states with larger commercial property markets tend to have better data set representation.

![](images/8-01.png){#fig-heatmap_fix}

## Concluding Thoughts

Clustering the categories into smaller subset of types will be difficult to accomplish.
The Compstak data set has a high Nan rate and does not suggest a compeltely consistent categorization methodology.
There is no industry dictionary glossary to reference (unlike DOE, [CoStar Glossary](https://www.costar.com/about/costar-glossary)).
With this said, It is best to stick to higher order property types, which is prone to less errors.
It may also be worthwhile to use standardized property codes, which is available in the data dictionary given, but is a "premium add on".
The Compstak data set covers industries reasonably but the geography coverage seems to be western and size biased.

Next steps, will now be working on producing the data set with the following fields Lat/lon , State, ZCTA, Type of business
