Notes

we have clear mappings 

DOE CoStar Property Type | CompStak Category | Notes
General Retail | Retail | Direct mapping
Industrial | Industrial | Direct mapping
Multi-Family | Multi-Family | Direct mapping
Office | Office | Direct mapping
Retail | Retail | Direct mapping
Hospitality | Hotel | Hospitality maps cleanly to Hotel

Ther rea unclear mappings

DOE CoStar Property Type | Why Ambiguous?
Flex | Could be Office, Industrial, or Mixed-Use
Health Care | Could be Other or sometimes Multi-Family (senior living)
Specialty | Catch-all, many weird asset types
Sports & Entertainment | Could be Other or Land or even Special Purpose
Unknown | No info, must rely on subtype

strategy is to look at this unclear costart main proerpty terms and look at their subproperties. If ther subproperties are complate then we are happy

the subproperties are not compete

so now we need to do a bit more analysis but elts match the ones we observe
